# UFOs

Dana is hometown has had several ufo sighting, which has led to an interest bout ufo sighting around the world. Dana would like to create a website using JavaScript and html, that pulls ufo sighting information from an object and display the data in a table for review. Additionally, Dana would like to add filters, to provide a clean way to find the desired information for the website visitor.

#Results

This webpage displays a table of ufo sightings, the criteria for the ufo sightings is date, city, state, country, and shape. When the page is first accessed it will display the data without any filters.

The web page has option to filter data by your own personal search criteria. On the left hand side you will see 5 input boxes that allow you to filter the data. Your options will be: date, city, state, country, and shape.

The visitor has the ability to search using a single filter or any combination of the five filters. The user must simply input their desired criteria and press enter or tab out of the search box.

Single filter search:

Multi-filter search:

To clear the filters a visitor can click the UFO Sightings tab located on the upper-left hand side of the page. Clicking this tab takes us back to the main page which clears the filters

#Summary

Overall, the page completes it mission, to display filtered date related to ufo sightings. However, the page is not perfect. One major draw back is lack of responsiveness to screen size. Right-now the page is does not adjust well to smaller screens or phones.

To fix this we added changes to the grids and included the xs classes to the code in order to make dynamic screen changes to smaller screen sizes.

Visually the “Filter Search” section is not very organized. The text and search boxes are not aligned properly.

Filter Search:

To fix this I have added <br> tages to the search box code in order display the box on a new line.

Search filter box code change:

After the change the Filter Search is organized and the text always sits above the search box.
